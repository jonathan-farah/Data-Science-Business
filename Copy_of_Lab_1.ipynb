        "\n",
        "There are two type of cells in notebook-style IDE: **Code Cell** and **Text Cell**. One key advantage of using a notebook-style IDE like Google Colab is the ability to break code into chunks, which can be executed independently through code cells. Unlike VS Code or Spyder, where the entire file typically needs to be run at once, notebook environments allow for a more modular and interactive approach. Notebook text cells use `markdown` syntax -- a rich text formatting language that allows you to write mathematical equations, add hyperlinks, and include formatted text and documents with ease. This structure makes notebooks especially useful for documenting your workflow and combining code with narrative explanations.\n",
